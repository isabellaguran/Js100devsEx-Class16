//Create a function that has a loop that prints '21' 21 times to the console and then call that function
function savage21(){
    for (i=1; i<22; i++){
        console.log('21')  //it will not run into our dom,because we didn`t call our function
    }
}

//let`s call our function so it can run:
savage21()
//Bonus can you make it print '21' 21 times to the dom?
//because we have our h2 with id into our html we can run in into the dom:
function savage21(){
    for (i=1; i<22; i++){
        document.querySelector('#savageSays').innerText += " 21" //we put innertext to see it in to the dom,also put this into anki cards
    }
}
savage21()
//putting 21 into the dom means on that page when is loading to be seen(it did it 21 times but very quick)
//to actually see it be done 21 times into the dom we put innerText +=" 21" and a little space between that 21
