//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number
let num=1;
//minus 10 from that number
num=num-10;
//print that number to the console
console.log(num);


//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input
let inputedVal=document.querySelector("#danceDanceRevolution").value;
//add 25 to that number
inputedVal=inputedVal+25; //or inputedVal+=25;
//alert that number
alert(inputedVal);  //HERE WE`RE CALLING THE FUNCTION IS A FUNCTION CALL IN jS THE ALERT FUNCTION IS ALREADY WRITED IN SO THAT`S WHY WE CAN CALL IT

//BUT IF WE WANTED TO CREATE A FUNCTION WE WILL DO THIS:
//function alert(x){ //HERE IS A FUNCTION DECLARATION WHEN YOUR CALLING A FUNCTION YOU`RE PASSING IN THE ARGUMENT,IN THIS CASE(X)x
//} //SEE HOW WE USED{}


//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1
const h1Holder=document.querySelector("h1");
//we use const and not let because we will not reasign the variable 


//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
h1Holder.addEventListener("clic",sum);
//this says add an event listener to the h1holder variable,that will listen when you will click on it(on h1) i want to run a function called sum
//Easier said,when i click on h1 ,run the function sum

//Now let`s go ahead and create the function sum becaus we don`t have it yet
function sum(){
console.log(num+ Number(inputedVal) );
}


//How we do explain all this now: WE HAD THE ORIGINAL VARIABLE CALLED "NUM" THAT HOLD THE NEGATIVE VALUE -9,AND THEN WE HAD THAT "inputedVal" THAT HOLDS +25,AND THEN WE ADDED A SMURF
//WE ADDED A SMURF THAT IS GOING TO CLICK ON OUR H1 WILL RUN THAT FUNCTION CALLED SUM,AND THAT SUM IS GOING TO BE THE SUM OF THE 2 PREVIOUS VARIABLES(NUM+INPUTEDVALUE)
//the result will be -925 because the input value was an empty string and we added to it 25,that means that became a string all of it.so we had now -9 plus string "25" and the result would be -925
//what we can do so we will have a number,is that we put console.log(num+number(inputedVal) ) instead of console.log(num+inputedVal);
//This is a way to put out a number value out fo a string
